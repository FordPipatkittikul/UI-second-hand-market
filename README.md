# Overview

A lot of students expecially students that leve in a dorm or need to move into other city after graduate have a problem that they have to throw all of good quality stuff away without making a good use of it. I see that and I feel like I want to solve those problem for them. So I decided to make an web application that university student can sell/buy an items among themselves.

ui-second-hand-market is a web application for students to view/sell/buy items among students. 


# Project Design

The frontend is being built by React styled with SCSS in **client folder**. `App.jsx`utilizes third pirty library [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview) for create a page routes. `layout.jsx` is the layout for all the pages. Each pages are responsive.
