# Overview

A lot of students expecially students that leve in a dorm or need to move into other city after graduate have a problem that they have to throw all of good quality stuff away without making a good use of it. I see that and I feel like I want to solve those problem for them. So I decided to make an web application that university student can sell/buy an items among themselves.

ui-second-hand-market is a web application for students to view/sell/buy items among students.
