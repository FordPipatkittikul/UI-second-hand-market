A lot of students that live in a dorm or need to move into other city after graduate have a problem that they have to throw all of good quality stuff away without making a good use of it. I see that and I feel like I want to solve those problem for them. So I decided to make an web application that university student can sell/buy an items among themselves.

ui-second-hand-market is a web application for students to view/sell/buy items among students. 

# Setting up
- For frontend, go to **client** directory and run `npm install`.
- For backend, go to **server** directory and run `npm install`.
- For database you will need MongoDB Atlas account and I can invite you to my project.

# Getting start
- For frontend, go to **client** directory and run `npm run dev`.
- For backend, go to **server** directory and run `console-ninja node --watch src/server.js` or run `npm start`. **quick note** I was using console ninja extension V.S. code for running server. It is basiclly nodemon but with logging option. Recommend using it.

# Credit
- My inspiration is from eBay and Facebook Marketplace

# Deployment
Frontend is hosting by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and backend server is hosting by [Render](https://render.com/). For server, I'm currently using free version so without request has been send to a server for a long time, the server will automatically shutdown and when server is about to operate, it will takes 50 seconds or more.
using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) for analyze user's behavior.
